## Description

Given an array of version strings `["1.0.2", "1.4.12", "3.2.6", "2.9.4", ...]`, sort the array in ascending order by major, minor and revision.

There will always be a major version, but you cannot always expect a minor or revision version provided in the string (i.e. some versions provided may be of the form `"4"` or `"3.1"`).

_**Example**_:\
Input: `["1.0.2", "0.3.1", "0.2.5", "1.6.4"]`\
Output: `["0.2.5", "0.3.1", "1.0.2", "1.6.4"]`

### Sample Structure

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> sortVersions(std::vector<std::string> versions) {
  // Your solution
}
```
